#Requests and APIS

- AJAX - Asynchronous Java And XML
- Asynchronous in AJAX means that the request doesn't block other request from happening.
- __Get Request__ - an internet request for data send from client to server.
- __Response__ - a server's response for request.
- Data:
  - XML <entry></entry>
  - JSON {property: data}
  - HTML >div></div
- __An asynchronous request__ can be fired off at any time (before or after a page has loaded) and the response to an asynchronous request often includes HTML that can be dynamically inserted into a page.
