# Log Analysis Project

In this project, I had to use my SQL database skills. I practiced interacting with a live database both from the command line and from your code. I have explored a large database with over a million rows. I have also  built and refined complex queries and use them to draw business conclusions from data.

In this project, I have used  PostgreSQL database. My task was to create a reporting tool that prints out reports (in plain text) based on the data in the database. This reporting tool is a Python program using the psycopg2 module to connect to the database.
