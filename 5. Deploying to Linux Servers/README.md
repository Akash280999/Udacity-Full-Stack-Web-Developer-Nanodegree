# LINUX SERVER CONFIGURATION PROJECT
> by Paulina Grunwald

This course is a part of [Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree).

My task in this project was to baseline installation of a Linux server and prepare it to host your web applications. I had to secure my server from a number of attack vectors, install and configure a database server, and deploy one of your existing web applications onto it.

This project develops deep understanding of exactly what your web applications are doing, how they are hosted, and the interactions between multiple systems are what define you as a Full Stack Web Developer. In this project, I was  responsible for turning a brand-new, bare bones, Linux server into the secure and efficient web application host your applications need.
