# Movie-Trailer-Project

This project is a par of Udacity's full-stack [nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree). The project required to build a simple movie trailer website project to showcase my favourite movies. In this project I have demonstrated the use of class in Python programming language as well as usage of CSS. The final outcome was to generate a static website which would display posters from my favourite movies. Whenever you clik on the poster the trailer to the movie's video would open.
