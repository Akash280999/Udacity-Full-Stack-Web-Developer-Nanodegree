# Build a Portfolio Site

This project is a par of Udacity's full-stack [nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree). For this project, I have built a portfolio website. I was provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and you had to replicate the design in HTML and CSS. Developing the protfolio website included display of images, adding description and links to completed project through the course  of my Nanodegree programe.

## Design and used code

Those are following steps I took before I started to work on writing code for this project:
1. Review Udacity  design mockup.
2. Design high level portfolio on a piece of paper. I have separated the portfolio website in number of sections taking into the conideration that I will use Boostrap 4 grid system.
3. Create index.html and style.css file.
4. Create high level a skeleton of the website including navbar, various sections (main, my skills and experience , projects and contact).
5. Create responsive and collapsible navigation bar. Here I have used Boostrap 4 class navbar-collapse. I split items on my navbar using nav-item class. After that I have added styling in style.css file (that included color of the navbar when static and while hovering and clicking on it).
6. Add header section (htop class). Here i have added text and styled it using h1 and h3 headers. For h3 I have used google font Indie Flower which I have imported in the head using:
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Indie+Flower" rel="stylesheet">
```
5. Add text to main and skills and experience section. H
