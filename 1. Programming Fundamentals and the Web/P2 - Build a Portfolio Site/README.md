# Build a Portfolio Site

This project is a par of Udacity's full-stack [nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/nanodegree). For this project, I have built a portfolio website. I was provided a design mockup as a PDF-file, and you had to replicate the design in HTML and CSS. Developing the protfolio website included display of images, adding description and links to completed project through the course  of my Nanodegree programe.
